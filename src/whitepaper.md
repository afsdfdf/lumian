## 5. Token Economic Model

### 5.1 Token Name and Symbol

We will launch a native token called **Lumina**, with the symbol **LUM**. The LUM token is the core of the AetherLink ecosystem, used to incentivize network participants, pay for network services, and participate in community governance.

### 5.2 Token Utility

The LUM token plays multiple critical roles in the network, ensuring the healthy operation and sustainable development of the ecosystem:

#### 5.2.1 Network Incentives

LUM tokens are the fundamental driver for incentivizing connectivity providers (hotspot owners, LSOs, backhaul providers, etc.) to contribute their physical infrastructure and network resources to the AetherLink network. These incentives are designed to reward behaviors that enhance the network's value, including:

* **Coverage Expansion:** Rewards for deploying hotspots in strategic locations that extend network coverage, with higher incentives for underserved areas.

* **Data Transmission:** Rewards proportional to the amount of data transmitted through a provider's infrastructure, encouraging efficient service provision.

* **Quality of Service:** Bonuses for maintaining high network reliability, low latency, and consistent throughput, as measured by network monitoring systems.

* **Network Longevity:** Increased rewards for long-term, stable participation in the network, reducing churn and enhancing network stability.

* **Community Participation:** Additional incentives for active participation in governance, technical support forums, and community development initiatives.

The incentive distribution algorithm is designed to be fair, transparent, and resistant to gaming or manipulation. It uses a combination of on-chain metrics and cryptographically secured off-chain data to calculate rewards accurately.

#### 5.2.2 Data Credits System

Data consumers need to burn LUM tokens to acquire Data Credits (DC), which are then used to access internet services provided by the AetherLink network. This mechanism creates a direct link between token value and network utility.

Key characteristics of the Data Credits system include:

* **Stable Pricing:** Data Credits are pegged to fiat currency (e.g., 1 DC = $0.00001 USD), ensuring that the cost of network services remains predictable regardless of LUM token price fluctuations.

* **Non-Transferable:** Once created, Data Credits are bound to the specific user account that created them and cannot be transferred to other users, preventing secondary markets and speculation.

* **Deflationary Mechanism:** When LUM tokens are burned to create Data Credits, they are permanently removed from circulation, creating deflationary pressure on the token supply as network usage increases.

* **Bulk Discounts:** Users who convert larger amounts of LUM to Data Credits at once receive bonus credits, encouraging larger, long-term commitments to the network.

* **Automated Conversion:** Smart contracts handle the conversion process transparently and efficiently, with the conversion rate automatically adjusting based on the current market price of LUM.

This system ensures that as network usage grows, the demand for LUM tokens increases while the supply decreases, creating a sustainable economic model that benefits all participants.

#### 5.2.3 Governance Participation

LUM token holders have the right to participate in network governance, including proposing and voting on protocol upgrades, fee structure adjustments, tokenomic model modifications, foundation fund usage, and other important network decisions. This ensures the network's decentralized and community-driven development direction.

The governance system includes several key components:

* **Proposal Mechanism:** Any LUM holder can submit proposals for network improvements or changes, with a minimum token threshold required to prevent spam.

* **Voting Power:** Voting power is proportional to the number of tokens held and/or staked, with potential quadratic voting mechanisms to prevent excessive concentration of power.

* **Delegation:** Token holders can delegate their voting rights to trusted representatives who actively participate in governance discussions.

* **Timelock and Execution:** Approved proposals undergo a timelock period before implementation, allowing for security reviews and giving users time to adjust to upcoming changes.

* **Governance Forums:** Off-chain discussion forums complement the on-chain voting system, enabling detailed debate and refinement of proposals before formal voting.

As the network matures, the governance system will evolve toward increasing decentralization, with the ultimate goal of full community control through a sophisticated DAO structure.

#### 5.2.4 Staking and Security

Participants can stake LUM tokens to earn additional rewards and enhance network security. Staking serves multiple purposes within the AetherLink ecosystem:

* **Validator Staking:** For blockchain consensus participants (if applicable to the selected underlying blockchain), staking serves as economic security to ensure honest validation.

* **Service Quality Assurance:** Connectivity providers may be required to stake tokens as a form of service guarantee, with penalties for poor performance or dishonest behavior.

* **Enhanced Rewards:** Stakers receive a portion of network fees and additional token emissions as rewards for their contribution to network security and liquidity reduction.

* **Governance Weight:** Staked tokens may receive additional weight in governance votes, encouraging long-term thinking and commitment to the network's success.

* **Tiered Benefits:** Different staking tiers provide varying levels of benefits, such as reduced fees, priority access to new features, or enhanced support services.

The staking mechanism is designed to align the interests of token holders with the long-term success of the network, reducing circulating supply while increasing network security and stability.

#### 5.2.5 Ecosystem Payments

LUM tokens serve as the payment medium for various services and products within the AetherLink ecosystem (e.g., hardware device purchases, premium service subscriptions, developer tool usage fees, etc.). This creates a comprehensive economic loop within the ecosystem:

* **Hardware Purchases:** Discounts or special offers when purchasing AetherLink-compatible devices using LUM tokens.

* **Premium Services:** Access to enhanced network features, priority bandwidth, or specialized services through token payments.

* **Developer Resources:** Payment for access to advanced APIs, development tools, or technical support services.

* **Marketplace Transactions:** Facilitation of transactions between ecosystem participants, such as LSOs contracting with backhaul providers or location owners.

* **Community Rewards:** Compensation for community contributions like bug reporting, content creation, or local support services.

By creating multiple use cases for the token within the ecosystem, AetherLink ensures consistent demand and utility beyond speculative value.

### 5.3 Token Distribution and Emission

Lumina's maximum supply is fixed at **10 billion** tokens. Tokens will be minted and distributed according to a predetermined emission schedule to ensure the network's long-term sustainable development and fairness. The specific allocation ratios and release plans are as follows:

| Allocation Category | Percentage | Description | Release Schedule |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Network Incentives** | 60% | Rewards for connectivity providers (hotspot owners, LSOs, backhaul providers) contributing to the network, including device deployment, bandwidth provision, and network stability maintenance. | Linear release with network growth and contribution volume, with higher emission rates in the first five years, gradually decreasing thereafter to incentivize early adopters. |
| **Ecosystem Development** | 15% | Support for developers, partners, research and development, marketing, and community building. | Gradual release to support the ecosystem's long-term development and innovation. |
| **Team and Advisors** | 15% | Tokens for the core team and advisors, designed to ensure alignment with the project's long-term interests. | Subject to strict lock-up periods (e.g., 1-2 years) and linear vesting schedules (e.g., 3-4 years) to ensure long-term commitment and contribution. |
| **Private and Public Sales** | 10% | Used for fundraising during the project's startup and early development stages. | Released in batches according to fundraising rounds and market conditions, with some potentially unlocked at TGE (Token Generation Event) and the remainder linearly vested. |

#### 5.3.1 Detailed Emission Schedule

The emission of LUM tokens follows a decreasing curve to control inflation and incentivize early participation:

**Year 1:** 20% of total network incentives allocation (1.2 billion LUM)
**Year 2:** 15% of total network incentives allocation (900 million LUM)
**Year 3:** 12% of total network incentives allocation (720 million LUM)
**Year 4:** 10% of total network incentives allocation (600 million LUM)
**Year 5:** 8% of total network incentives allocation (480 million LUM)
**Years 6-10:** 35% of total network incentives allocation (2.1 billion LUM), decreasing by 1% each year
**Years 11+:** Remaining network incentives allocation (600 million LUM), with community governance determining the specific emission rate

This decreasing emission schedule creates stronger incentives for early network participants while ensuring long-term sustainability. The specific emission parameters can be adjusted through community governance to optimize for changing network conditions and market environments.

#### 5.3.2 Network Incentive Distribution Algorithm

The distribution of network incentives among connectivity providers follows a sophisticated algorithm that considers multiple factors:

* **Coverage Quality:** Measured through periodic proof-of-coverage challenges and user connection data
* **Data Transmission Volume:** The amount of data processed by each node
* **Service Uptime:** Percentage of time the node is online and available
* **Service Quality:** Metrics including latency, packet loss, and throughput
* **Geographic Importance:** Higher rewards for coverage in underserved areas
* **Network Participation History:** Longevity and consistency of contribution

The algorithm is designed to be resistant to gaming or manipulation while rewarding genuine contributions to network value. It will evolve over time based on community feedback and changing network priorities.

### 5.4 Mint, Buyback, and Burn Mechanisms

AetherLink adopts a token economic model incorporating minting (Mint), buyback (Buyback), and burning (Burn) mechanisms to achieve token value stability and growth, ensuring close alignment with network utility:

#### 5.4.1 Minting Mechanism

New LUM tokens are minted according to the predetermined emission schedule and allocated to network contributors as incentives. This ensures the network has continuous incentives to attract new participants and expand infrastructure. The minting process is completely transparent and executed automatically through smart contracts.

Key aspects of the minting mechanism include:

* **Predictable Supply:** The emission schedule is predetermined and transparent, allowing participants to plan accordingly.
* **Performance-Based Distribution:** Newly minted tokens are distributed based on quantifiable contributions to the network.
* **Governance Oversight:** The community can propose and vote on adjustments to emission parameters as the network evolves.
* **Mint Caps:** Hard caps on periodic emissions prevent unexpected inflation.

#### 5.4.2 Burning Mechanism

When data consumers use internet services, they burn LUM tokens to obtain Data Credits. All LUM tokens used to acquire Data Credits are permanently destroyed, reducing the circulating supply. This "use-and-burn" mechanism tightly couples token value with actual network usage and growth, creating deflationary pressure.

The burning process includes several important features:

* **Transparent Execution:** All token burns are recorded on-chain and publicly verifiable.
* **Automatic Price Adjustment:** The Data Credit conversion rate automatically adjusts based on the current market price of LUM tokens.
* **Burn Acceleration:** As network usage increases, the rate of token burning increases proportionally.
* **Burn Reporting:** Regular reports on burn statistics help the community understand the impact on token supply.

#### 5.4.3 Buyback Mechanism

The AetherLink Foundation or future DAO will consider using a portion of network revenue (e.g., network service fees, platform transaction fees) to buy back LUM tokens from the open market and burn them. The buyback mechanism further reduces the circulating supply, enhances token scarcity and value, and provides additional value capture for token holders.

Buyback operations follow these principles:

* **Transparent Execution:** All buyback activities are announced in advance and executed through transparent mechanisms.
* **Market Impact Minimization:** Buybacks are conducted in ways that minimize market disruption.
* **Community Approval:** Major buyback programs require governance approval.
* **Strategic Timing:** Buybacks may be timed to provide market stability during periods of volatility.

#### 5.4.4 Economic Equilibrium and Sustainability

The combination of these mechanisms creates a balanced economic system:

* **During Network Growth:** As more users join and use the network, more tokens are burned through the Data Credit system, creating upward pressure on token value that offsets the inflationary effect of new token emissions.

* **At Network Maturity:** When the network reaches a stable state, the burning rate from regular network usage should approximately balance the reduced emission rate, creating price stability while maintaining adequate incentives for network maintenance.

* **Long-term Sustainability:** The decreasing emission schedule, combined with continued token burning from network usage, ensures the long-term sustainability of the token economy even as the network reaches global scale.

This carefully designed token economic model creates a virtuous cycle where network growth directly benefits all ecosystem participants while ensuring the long-term viability of the AetherLink platform.

### 5.5 Treasury Management and Sustainability

The AetherLink ecosystem maintains a treasury to ensure long-term sustainability and support ongoing development. The treasury is funded through multiple sources:

* **Initial Token Allocation:** A portion of the ecosystem development allocation is reserved for treasury operations.
* **Network Fees:** A small percentage of network transaction fees is directed to the treasury.
* **Partnership Revenue:** Revenue from strategic partnerships and enterprise agreements.
* **Grants and Donations:** External funding sources that support the network's mission.

Treasury funds are allocated through transparent governance processes to support:

* **Core Protocol Development:** Funding the ongoing development and improvement of the AetherLink protocol.
* **Security Audits:** Regular security reviews and bug bounty programs.
* **Community Growth:** Marketing, education, and community-building initiatives.
* **Research and Innovation:** Exploration of new technologies and approaches to enhance network capabilities.
* **Legal and Regulatory Compliance:** Ensuring the network operates within relevant legal frameworks globally.

As the governance system matures, treasury management will transition fully to the community DAO, with transparent reporting and accountability mechanisms to ensure proper stewardship of resources.

### 5.6 Economic Security and Attack Resistance

The AetherLink token economy is designed with multiple safeguards against potential economic attacks:

* **Sybil Attack Resistance:** Hardware requirements and identity verification mechanisms prevent the creation of fake identities to manipulate rewards.
* **Stake-Based Security:** Critical network functions require token staking, making attacks economically costly.
* **Slashing Mechanisms:** Malicious behavior results in stake reduction or forfeiture, creating strong disincentives for attacks.
* **Gradual Reward Distribution:** Rewards are distributed over time rather than immediately, reducing the profitability of short-term manipulation strategies.
* **Economic Modeling:** Sophisticated economic models simulate various attack scenarios to identify and address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

These security measures ensure that the cost of attacking the network exceeds any potential benefit, protecting the integrity of the AetherLink ecosystem and the value of LUM tokens.

### 5.7 Token Market Support and Liquidity

To ensure a healthy token market with adequate liquidity, AetherLink implements several supporting strategies:

* **Exchange Listings:** Strategic listings on major cryptocurrency exchanges to provide trading access and liquidity.
* **Liquidity Provision:** Establishment of liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges with appropriate incentives for liquidity providers.
* **Market Maker Partnerships:** Collaboration with professional market makers to ensure orderly markets and reasonable bid-ask spreads.
* **OTC Desks:** Support for over-the-counter trading services for large transactions to minimize market impact.
* **Token Utility Expansion:** Continuous development of new token use cases to drive organic demand.

These measures help ensure that token holders can enter and exit positions with minimal slippage, while maintaining price discovery mechanisms that reflect the network's fundamental value.

In this phase, the Foundation will actively seek community feedback, laying the groundwork for future DAO governance.

2. **Joint Governance Phase:** As the network matures and the community grows, the Foundation will gradually introduce on-chain governance modules, sharing decision-making with token holders. During this phase, important protocol upgrades, token economic parameter adjustments, and treasury fund usage will require dual confirmation from both the Foundation and community voting.

3. **Complete DAO Governance Phase:** Ultimately, AetherLink will be fully governed by its DAO. LUM token holders will use the on-chain voting system to propose, discuss, and decide on all major matters, including:
   * **Protocol Upgrades and Technical Roadmap:** Determining AetherLink's future development direction and technical upgrade plans.
   * **Token Economic Model Adjustments:** Adjusting token emission rates, burning mechanisms, staking rewards, and other key economic parameters.
